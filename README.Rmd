## Introduction

Welcome to **ReliaGrowR**! This package provides modeling and plotting functions for Reliability Growth Analysis (RGA), including:  

* Duane Analysis
* Crow-AMSAA
* Piecewise NHPP
* Piecewise NHPP with Change Point Detection

To learn more about RGA and this package, please view the [vignette](https://paulgovan.github.io/ReliaGrowR/articles/RGA.html).

## Installation

To install the release version of ReliaGrowR, use:

``` r
install_packages('ReliaGrowR')
```

You can install the development version of ReliaGrowR like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github('paulgovan/ReliaGrowR')
```

## Example

Here is a basic example of Reliability Growth Analysis:

First, load the package:
```{r}
library(ReliaGrowR)
```

Next, set up some cumulative time and failure data:
```{r}
times <- c(100, 200, 300, 400, 500)
failures <- c(1, 2, 1, 3, 2)
```

Then run the rga and plot the results:
```{r}
result <- rga(times, failures)
plot(result, main = "Reliability Growth Analysis", xlab = "Cumulative Time", ylab = "Cumulative Failures")
```
